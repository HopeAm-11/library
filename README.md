# library

A Library app created using HTML,CSS and JS 


# How the library works 

- When a user click on a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: 

    author, 
    title, 
    number of pages, 
    whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.
    
- Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library. 
- Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
